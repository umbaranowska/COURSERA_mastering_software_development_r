# COURSERA Mastering Software Development in R Specialization
Solutions and scripts from Mastering Software Development with R Specialization on Coursera I am currently working on (Dec 2021 - Jan 2022)

- **01_The_R_Environment/ReadingAndSummarizingData.R** - Reading and Summarizing Data Quiz Solutions
- **02_Advanced_R_Programming/factorial_code.R** - 4 approaches to a factorial function: loop, purrr::reduce(), recursion and memoization
- **02_Advanced_R_Programming/factorial_microbenchmark.R** - code for comparing the 4 factorial functions using microbenchmark package
- **02_Advanced_R_Programming/factorial_output.txt** - results of comparins the 4 factorial functions using microbenchmark (required to submit the assigment)
- **02_Advanced_R_Programming/oop_code.R** - code for setting classes and methods in order to get the rewuired output based on the script and data provided
- **03_Building_R_Packages/fars_functions.R** - functions that had to be documented for the 2nd peer reviewed assignment and later used in the 4th assignment to build an R package
- **04_Building_Data_Visualization_Tools/geom_hurricane.R** - code for creating a new ggplot2 geom for plotting hurricanes on a map

Data files and some scripts for generating outputs that were provided as part of the instructions are not included in the repository, it's assumed course participants can download them themselves and add /data folders where necessary or access instructions if necessary.
Course 3 week 4 assignment was building an R package using functions from a previous assignment and posting it on github, therefore the solution has been put in a separate repository here: INSERT LINK WHEN FINISHED
